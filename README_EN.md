# Front-End Coding

## Project Overview

This project involves creating web pages using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular. The goal is to apply knowledge gained from a front-end course at SENAI, focusing on building interactive and responsive interfaces. Activities include developing an e-commerce page with an image carousel and a featured products section, as well as a simple login page with validation and styling.

## üî® Project Features

### Visual Examples of the Project

1. **Main Activity**: Development of an e-commerce page with the following features:
    - **Image Carousel**: A carousel component displaying product or promotional images, allowing navigation between images with arrows and indicators.
    - **Featured Products Section**: Highlighted area to present popular or on-sale products. Each product includes an image, name, description, and price.
    - **Responsive Layout**: Use of Bootstrap to ensure the page adapts to different screen sizes, providing a consistent experience on mobile and desktop devices.
